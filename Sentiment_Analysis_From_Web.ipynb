       "0  For someone with such a fiercely individual sound,Daniel Lopatinhas developed a surprisingly wide-ranging roster of collaborators over the years:ANOHNI,the Weeknd,Rosalía—evenIggy Pop. All of those artists fall far from the hazy zone that Lopatin has mapped out with hisOneohtrix Point Neverproject, in which dead media and outmoded technology collide with high-definition sound-sculpting, to frequently nostalgic effect.Elizabeth Fraser, on the other hand, feels like an indirect influence on Lopatin’s music:Cocteau Twins’ soft, gelatinous sound worlds lay the spongy groundwork for his own shape-shifting fantasia, and occasionally can even be heard echoing through OPN’s hall of mirrors—as onMagic Oneohtrix Point Never’s “Imago,” for instance, which sounds like the Cocteau Twins andHarold Budd’sThe Moon and the Melodiesbeing squished through Lopatin’s digital wringer.Fraser herself is barely audible in this collaborative revamp ofMagic Oneohtrix Point Never’s “Tales From the Trash Stratum,”  a bonus track on thenew Blu-Ray editionof the album; at least, she’s barely identifiable. You might not immediately guess from her impressionist daubs of tone color that it is her voice. Fraser’s work in the Cocteau Twins developed a reputation for being indecipherable: inventing words, twisting her syntax, and generally letting the sound of her syllables take precedence over boring old linguistic meaning.

       "0  Here is a song that will make you long to be back in a concrete arena filled with 20,000 new friends, singing together in a way that makes you think, if only for a moment, that humanity might not be swirling toward total catastrophe. You can feel the stick on the soles of your feet just by listening to this thing. You can smell the frankfurters. It’s the type of anthem that makes one of those $18 Budweisers in a commemorative plastic cup seem like a damn bargain—a small price to pay to briefly heighten some sense of communion after a year and a half of pandemic seclusion.Everything about the title track tothe War on Drugs’upcoming fifth albumis gloriously unsubtle, including its opening lines. “I was lying in my bed/A creature void of form,” sings bandleader Adam Granduciel,noddingto Dylan. “Been so afraid of everything/I need a chance to be reborn.” And honestly, whodoesn’tfeel like that right now? Cue the synths reminiscent of Don Henley’s “Boys of Summer,” the drums sparkling enough to make ’80s stadium-rock guru Mutt Lange bow down in appreciation, and the gospel-tinged backing vocals that urge you to believe in something beyond yourself. Granduciel has been meticulously mining classic rock sounds for more than a decade, but never quite like this; his Springsteen fandom is well-documented (his young son is named Bruce) but he’s never made a song as welcoming as “Hungry Heart” until now.“I Don’t Live Here Anymore” celebrates getting to the point in life when you’re no ...   \n",
