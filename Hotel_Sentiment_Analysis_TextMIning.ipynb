Then went back and ran models again with these features included. It did not make a difference in the accuracy at all. I began with Max df at .95 and min df at .05. When I changed these to .90 and .10 the accuracy was worsened. I then adjusted to .80 and .20 and this was even worse. I then increased the Max Df to .99 and Min df to .01 and the accuracy here improved across the board.\n"
